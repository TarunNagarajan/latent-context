# Plasticity
In the era of dynamic data and non-stationary environments, traditional neural networks often fall short in adaptability, memory efficiency, and contextual awareness. They are designed to learn from static datasets and assume that underlying distributions remain fixed, which rarely aligns with real-world applications.

The goal is to create a neural system that not only learns but also selectively remembers, forgets, and adjusts itself based on temporal relevance.
